= How to use a (un)ordered list in DUBB =

To use lists in DUBB you need to be sure you have the file ~List.php~ in the _Tag_ directory. It's in DUBB since version 1.4.1.

1) To create a list you need to be sure _list_ is registered in DUBB. Since the styletag function List uses a second optional parameter, you have to register it as follow.

{{{
DUBB::registerTag('list' , array(1 , 2));
}}}

2) A (un)ordered list has multiple list items, these list items are grouped between square brackets. List items are separated by the follow symbol ~|~. You can choose between _ol_ or _ul_ for the list type.

{{{
[list item 1 | list item 2 | list item 3].{list(ul)}
}}}

3) You can also change the list item style. Here's a overview of styles you can use for each list type.

|| *ul* || *ol* ||
|| none || none ||
|| circle || ||
|| disc || ||
|| square || ||

For example:

{{{
[list item 1 | list item 2 | list item 3].{list(ul , square)}
}}}

4) You can create nested lists to.

{{{
[list item 1 | list item 2 [sub item 1 | sub item 2].list(ol) | list item 3].{list(ul)}
}}}

This create the follow output:

* list item 1
* list item 2
 # sub item 1
 # sub item 2
* list item 3
